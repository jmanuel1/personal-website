Your project is now converted to Yarn! Thank you for using Bower!

You should find all bower components in node_modules/@bower_components

The postinstall script should also link it to old location of components

It is advisable to remove postinstall script and point your tools
to point to node_modules/@bower_components instead, though.

You may also consider creating separate directory for front-end project with separate package.json
