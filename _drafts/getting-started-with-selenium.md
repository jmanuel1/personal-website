## What is Selenium?

Selenium is a web automation tool. You can use Selenium to programmatically
interact with an Internet browser. That means that you can write code using
[Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) or record
browser interactions with [Selenium
IDE](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/) and use the resulting program to
control a browser without human intervention.

I won't go into possible uses for Selenium in this post. If you're interested in
that, you can visit [the Selenium homepage](https://www.seleniumhq.org) or a
[previous post of mine]({% post_url 2019-08-24-the-uses-of-selenium %}).

## Downloading Selenium

<!-- QUESTION: Do we need this step? -->
Go to [Selenium's download page](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/). You'll
want to download the Selenium Standalone Server. Save the jar file you get to a
directory called `se-get-started`.

For Selenium to be useful, we'll need a *web driver*. Selenium uses this program
to interface with a web browser and control it. For our purposes, we'll download
the Google Chrome web driver from the [ChromeDriver download
page](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) into the
`se-get-started` directory.
