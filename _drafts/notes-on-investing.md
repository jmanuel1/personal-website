Recently, I've been trying to learn more about stock-market investing so that I
can have better control over my money. To guide my learning process, I've been
using the Simple Programmer course ["10 Steps To Learn Anything
Quickly"](https://simpleprogrammer.com/products/learn-anything-quickly). Here
are some of the notes I've written with minimal edits apart from organization
and formatting.

## Risk and Reward

- Risk is *basically* the possibility of losing money. We can observe it as
  early in 1300-1500 in Venetian prestiti (historical European annuity that only
  paid interest) prices.
- "the most important concept in finance, that *risk and return are inextricably
  connected*" - [Four Pillars](https://smile.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW/).
  If you want a chance at high returns, you have to shoulder high risks. If you
  want safety, you have to deal with "meager" rewards.
  - The lower price you pay now, the higher future returns will be, and vice
    versa.
  - Don't confuse the future with the past: high previous returns often mean low
    future returns and vice versa.
  - So buy when prices are low. Unfortunately, this is usually scary because low
    prices are not possible without risk.
- Two flavors of risk: short/long-term
- Promises of safety + very high returns => probably fraud
- Historical returns are of limited use in predicting future returns; the
  historical record is better as a gauge of risk

## Stocks, Bills, Bonds, and ETFs

- A short/long-term obligation is a bill/bond
- Don't use bond returns in the 20th century to predict future bond returns,
  because there was the monetary shock of moving away from gold
- End-period wealth a better indicator of long-term risk than annualized returns
- Stocks are mean reverting: bad/good years are likely to be followed by
  good/bad years
- Bond returns don't mean revert
- market cap(tialization) :: total value of a company's outstanding stock
- most market indices are market cap weighted
- stocks of small companies have higher returns than large companies
- ETFs are ok, but you can do better if you're willing to take on more risk

## Fear and Greed

- Fear and greed will ruin returns
- "Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful."
  -- Warren Buffet
- Avoid idolizing wealth and security
- Don't invest in anything you don't understand
- Understand the incentives of people giving advice

## Managing Funds

- Pay off high-interest debt and have an emergency fund before starting
